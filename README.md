# Interfaces Example
*An interface contains definitions for a group of related functionalities that a non-abstract class or a struct must implement.*
- By using interfaces, you can, for example, include behavior from multiple sources in a class. 
- That capability is important in C# because the language doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes.
